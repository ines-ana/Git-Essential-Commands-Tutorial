# Tracked Files

using the starter-web project we have created before:

on terminal, in the project directory: mate lero-lero.txt —&gt; add some more text —&gt; git commit -a -m “Adding more text” \(-a to add as we commit, we combine 2 commands into one!\)

git status

A tracked file is any file that git is aware of and tracking actively; any file that has already been committed into the repository or added to the git index or the git staging area

how to find out if a file is being tracked by git? git ls-files

files are tracked after they have been added \(git add\), before that they are not tracked!
