### Why Command Line?

Starting off with the command line is the best way to learn git:

1. Online help: nearly all tutorials and websites use the command line as the standard way to communication how git does something \(git cammands\)

2. Higher power: only the command line provides all the power of git

3. Consistent: can be consistency applied on Terminal for Mac/Linux or Git Bash for Windows

### Why use source control?

* Backup / Archive
* Versioning / History \(includes the history of that backup, what has changed\)
* Undo changes
* Comparison between versions
* Collaboration and team work
* Allows for isolation of changes
* Code review

### Why Git?

#### Git is:

Decentralized and distributed \(donâ€™t need to be connected to the server to make changes in the projects, most operations are local\) source control system

Scales massively

most operations are local \(comparisons and completes\)

very fast

free and open source

active community with several resources online

most popula VCS and DVCS
