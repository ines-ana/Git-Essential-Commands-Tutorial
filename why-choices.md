### Why use source control?

* Backup / Archive
* Storing versions \(properly\)
* Versioning / History \(includes the history of that backup, what has changed\)
* Undo changes
* Comparison between versions
* Collaboration and team work
* Allows for isolation of changes
* Code review

# Are there many other VCS, besides Git?

### 

### Why Git?

#### Git is:

* Decentralized and distributed \(donâ€™t need to be connected to the server to make changes in the projects, most operations are local\) source control system
* Scales massively
* most operations are local \(comparisons and completes\)
* very fast
* free and open source
* active community with several resources online
* most popula VCS and DVCS



### Tools used in this tutorial:

* Git commands are written in the command line
* The choosen Git reporsitory is [GitHub](https://github.com).

### Why using the command line to learn Git?

Starting off with the command line is the best way to learn git, mainly because of the following three reasons:

1. **Online help:** nearly all tutorials and websites use the command line as the standard way to communication how git does something \(git cammands\)

2. **Higher power:** only the command line provides all the power of git

3. **Consistent:** can be consistency applied on Terminal for Mac/Linux or Git Bash for Windows
